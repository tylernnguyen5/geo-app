# Geo App

Hi, this is an application I created so that users can send comments or messages to other people's virtual wall. 

The user will signup with an email, password and alias to start with. Then they will have access to a map where they can find markers of other users. Clicking on these markers would take them to a user's wall with all the comments/messages displayed from all the other users. 

You can try it out [here](https://geo-app-d1f15.web.app/).
